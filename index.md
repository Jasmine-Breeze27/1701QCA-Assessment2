# 1701QCA Making Interaction - Assessment 2 workbook

You will use this workbook to keep track of your progress through the course and also as a process journal to document the making of your projects. The comments in italics throughout the template give suggestions about what to include. Feel free to delete those instructions when you have completed the sections.

When you have completed the template, submit the link to the GitHub Pages site for this repository as a link in Learning@Griffith. The link should be something like [https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment2/](https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment2/) where `qcainteractivemedia` is replaced with your GitHub username and `1701QCA-Assessment2` is replaced with whatever you called the repository this template is contained in when you set it up.

## Project working title ##
Mood Cube

### Related project 1 ###
Ever Blooming Mechanical Tulip

https://www.hackster.io/jiripraus/ever-blooming-mechanical-tulip-1b0323

![Image](everbloomingtulip.PNG)

This project is related to mine because of the use of light, and movement to present emotions in an interactive way. This flower includes a smaller leaf which is connected to a touch sensor. When activated, the flower will begin to bloom with the LED's shining multiple colours. 

### Related project 2 ###
Solar Powered LED Parking Sensor

https://www.hackster.io/aams86/solar-powered-led-parking-sensor-9dd11d

This project is related to mine because it uses LED's to reflect something; in this case, the proximity of a car. The mood cube uses LED's to reflect mood and an emotional state.

### Related project 3 ###
Stereo NeoPixel Ring VU Meter

This project is related to mine because the LED's react to a change in the device. In the mood cube the change would be orientation, whereas in the uv meter, it is the dials on the back.

### Related project 4 ###
Virtual Arduino Tennis

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/gatoninja236/virtual-arduino-tennis-3700ce?ref=tag&ref_id=accelerometer&offset=4

This project is related to mine because it uses an accelerometer to trigger LEDs. The Arduino Tennis project has used its accelerometer to interact with a neopixel matrix in order to simulate playing tennis. My chosen project is similar because the accelerometer triggers the LEDs to change, only in a simpler way.

Vernal

This project is related to mine because the movement of the object controls the behaviour of the LEDs. This custom dress reacts to the wearer's movements by illuminating the lights that were stiched inside. My project also uses movement to light specific LEDs.

### Related project 6 ###
Gesture Control Robot

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/raunak-oberai/gesture-control-robot-ff1307?ref=tag&ref_id=accelerometer&offset=1

This project is related to mine because an acceleromter has been used to control another device. In this case, the orientation of the operators hand is controlling a robot whereas the mood cube uses orientation to simply switch the colour of an LED to its corresponding side.

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
A tangible object that expresses mood through orientation.

### Design concept 1 ###
*Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a rough sketch of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

A 3D hexagonal shape that changes colour depending on orientation. It would contain an accelerometer that measures changes in orientation to signify a specific colour for an LED. The purpose of this is to have a tangible object that someone can physically turn  to express their mood or emotional state.


### Design concept 2 ###
*Put details here.*

A hanging mood cube that changes colour depending on the orientation. It would contain an accelerometer that measures the change in orientation in order to display a specific colour via LED. The purpose of this object is for someone to physically see their mood and emotional state.

### Final design concept ###
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

A mood cube that displays different colours when placed on each of its sides. It would contain an accelerometer that measure the change in orientation in order to display a specific coluur via LED. The purpose of this object to provide a physical object that can be oriented in order to express mood or emotional state.

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
